This directory has a test program for testing crash_handler on ARM
systems.

The program fault-test is built in multiple configurations, with different
compilation flags and with and without stripping.

To run fault-test, install it on target, and run:
 $ ./fault-test 5

The argument to fault-test is the number of seconds to count down before
the fault occurs.  This is used to delay fault-test, so you can arrange
the machine environment (or a debugger) before the fault.

If the crash_handler is installed, this should result in the creation
of a crash report in /tmp/crash_report.

= Why different fault-test versions? =
Fault-test is built with different compiler options in order to test how
the stack unwinder in the crash_handler works with different program
types.  If the program uses frame-pointers, or an unwind table, then the
backtrace generated by the corresponding unwinder should be correct.  In
cases where a program is compiled without frame-pointers and without
unwind information, and is stripped (very common in the embedded case),
then the unwinder may get confused, and the backtrace might be incorrect
or incomplete.  Having different test program versions allows for
testing the different types, to see how the unwinders behave.
