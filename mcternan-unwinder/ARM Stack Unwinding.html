  <h1>ARM Stack Unwinding</h1>
 August 2007
</center>
<hr>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Languages like C++ and Java have very useful facilities that allow a stack
trace to be collected and displayed in a variety of ways.  In Java, a snapshot
of the current stack trace can be taken simply by constructing a
<CODE>Throwable</CODE> object, and the trace can be displayed using the
<CODE>printStackTrace()</CODE> method.
</p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
    Throwable t = new Throwable();

    t.printStackTrace(System.out);
</pre></div>
<p class="caption">Example 1: Displaying the current call stack in Java.</p>
<p>
C++ offers similar facilities, and because of this, both these languages can
provide useful information when an unexpected failure occurs and is
detected.  For example, assertions maybe placed in the code with the failure
action being to display the current stack trace to help the programmer debug
the cause.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately C offers no such inbuilt luxury, and as such, debugging without a
debugger or other logging mechanism maybe a little more difficult in the
first instance.  This interests me as I've worked as an embedded engineer
creating software for consumer devices which are extensively field tested
containing code that makes extensive use of assertion macros.  I decided to
investigate stack unwinding in order to enable better information to be
gathered from devices that have failed in the field, with a goal to supporting
stack tracing without the need for expensive or cumbersome supporting hardware.
</p>
<p>
Therefore I decided to make an ARM stack unwinder that would be suitable to
run on an embedded target to provide stack trace capabilities for C, similar
to those already enjoyed by other languages.
</p>
<h2>Design Consideration</h2>
<p>
Since the target is an embedded processor in a consumer device, there are
some restrictions on how the solution can be engineered and what options
are available.  At the same time, knowing the target processor is likely
to be an ARM7 or similar processor using the ARM and Thumb Instruction Set
Architectures allows the solution to be targeted specifically to this
family of RISC processors.
</p>
<p>
The restrictions imposed by the embedded target are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>There is little free storage (RAM or ROM).
<li>Large amounts of code will run from FLASH and cannot be modified.
<li>The form factor device cannot be directly connected to a debugger.
</ul>
<p>
Since storage is at a premium on these devices, I decided to forego use of
debug tables as these would need embedding on the target and would be large,
even if compressed.  Since code runs from FLASH, I also have to be careful
that the solution does not try and patch any code - one stack unwinding
approach described in the ARM APCS document is to 'patch' function entries
and exits and to then execute code to cause the stack adjustments to be made
and stack frames unwound.  (Patching code in FLASH is not easy since FLASH
can generally only be erased in blocks and then written once i.e. it is not
truly random access. Additionally erasing any block of FLASH could potentially
permanently damage the device until it is reprogrammed, so that is a risk
and complexity best avoided if at all possible).
</p>
<p>
Finally the form factor devices usually don't bring out connectors for
debugging such as JTAG.  This may sound weird, but all the pins on the
package inside the device have a use and JTAG is usually multiplexed with
something that is generally more useful, and exposing debug interfaces is
also considered a security issue and frowned upon in the industry.
Additionally having less external connectors makes Electrostatic Discharge
(ESD) protection simpler as well as having other small benefits.  And in
any case, Java requires no debugger to grab a stack trace, so why should C?
</p>
<h2>Method</h2>
<p>
Given the above restrictions, I decided that the best approach is to write
a small model of the ARM processor which can interpret the code and look for
the tell-tale signs of functions returning to divine the call stack.  Yup,
I decided to write a model ARM processor to run on the ARM to interpret the
code with the aim of unwinding the stack, as opposed to producing bit exact
interpretation of the code.  Implementing the model ARM provides a couple
of challenges that are laid out in the following subsections.
</p>
<h3>Function Epilogs</h3>
<p>
All functions look pretty much the same.  They have a prologue, a main body
and an epilogue.  The compiler generates the prologue and epilogue on almost
all functions (IRQ handling functions can be an explicit exception to this)
to setup and teardown the stack frame used during the function body for things
such as local variables.  Debug tables can give details about the location
of function prologues and epilogues to assist debuggers in interpreting the
stack at any time, but I don't have these, so have to locate them
automatically.
</p>
<p>
Since this is targeted at ARM processors, only ARM functions need to be
considered.  Looking at a few epilogues, it can be seen that they generally
look the same and take the format shown in the following examples:
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
ADD      sp,#0x28
POP      {r4-r6,pc}
</pre></div>
<p class="caption">Example 2: Function epilog in Thumb.</p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
ADD      sp,sp,#0x28
LDMFD    sp!,{r4-r6,pc}
</pre></div>
<p class="caption">Example 3: Function epilog in ARM.</p>
<p>
The examples show a stack adjustment to remove storage allocated for locals,
then a restoration of the corrupted registers as required by the ARM ABI,
and the restoration of the program counter (PC) from the stack effectively
executing the return.  The return is very similar and can be detected easily
regardless of processor operating mode (Thumb or ARM), although this raises
an interesting question.  The examples show a return that is only suitable
if the function is always called from code in the same operating mode as the
function itself i.e. the Thumb return code can only be used if returning to
Thumb code, and the same is also true for ARM code.  Practically it is
sometimes the case that ARM code may call Thumb functions and vice versa,
and this is known as interworking.  Fortunately the ARM ABI also describes
interworking and more examples can be generated to show function epilogues
used when interworking is required.
</p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
ADD      sp,#0x28
POP      {r4-r6}
POP      {r3}
BX       r3
</pre></div>
<p class="caption">Example 4: Function epilog in Thumb with interworking.</p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
ADD      sp,sp,#0x28
LDMFD    sp!,{r4-r6,lr}
BX       lr
</pre></div>
<p class="caption">Example 5: Function epilog in ARM with interworking.</p>
<p>
With interworking, the <CODE>BX</CODE> instruction is used to enable the
processor mode to be changed at the same time as returning from the function.
In each case, the return address is restored to a register before being used
with the <CODE>BX</CODE> instruction to cause the return, where the least
significant bit of the return address is used to indicate the desired
processor mode once the branch has been taken.  So we now have a good idea
of what we need to detect in order to determine where a function exits -
the reading of a return address from the stack, it being loaded into the
PC either directly by the load, or via a <CODE>BX</CODE> instruction.</p>
<p>
The first thing in the model ARM is therefore to store not only register
contents, but a bit of data about where the contents originated from.  To
do this, I've made a couple of types for my model ARM to use.
</p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
typedef enum
{
    REG_VAL_INVALID      = 0x00,
    REG_VAL_FROM_STACK   = 0x01,
    REG_VAL_FROM_MEMORY  = 0x02,
    REG_VAL_FROM_CONST   = 0x04,
    REG_VAL_ARITHMETIC   = 0x80
}
RegValOrigin;

typedef struct
{
    Int32              v;
    RegValOrigin       o;
}
RegData;
</pre></div>
<p class="caption">Code 1: Representation of a register in the model ARM.</p>
<p>
Creating an array of <CODE>RegData</CODE> structures then allows the register
file to be emulated.  The Program Counter (PC) and Stack Pointer (SP) can be
added to the register file to give the model a basis to interpret code.</p>
<p>
At this point, two basic loops are added to the model - one to interpret Thumb
code, and one to interpret ARM code and decoding for the <CODE>POP</CODE> and
<CODE>LDMFD</CODE> instructions are added respectively.  When a value is loaded
to a register, the <CODE>RegValOrigin</CODE> can now be updated to indicate that
the data originated on the stack, <CODE>REG_VAL_FROM_STACK</CODE>, making it
easy to spot a function returning when a <CODE>BX</CODE> is encountered for
such a tracked register.  Interpretation of <CODE>BX</CODE> is therefore
added to both the ARM and Thumb modes, faithfully checking the LSB of the
branch address to change the interpretation mode between ARM and Thumb as
needed.</p>
<p>
At this point, the model ARM is capable of detecting the return from a
function.  This is a good start, but it needs to handle the stack adjustment
if it is to be able to unwind more than one stack frame.  In the examples seen
so far, the stack adjust has just been the addition of
<CODE>0x28</cODE> to the stack pointer, although this will not always be the
case.  Depending on the amount of stack data utilised by a function, the stack
adjust maybe for a different value, and unfortunately not all adjustments can
be accommodated by a single instruction.  The following shows an odd C function
and the generated assembly.</P>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">

{
    char biggie[0x81111];
    char *c = biggie;
    int  t;

    sprintf(biggie, "Hello");

    t = 0;

    while(*c)
    {
        t += *c;
        c++;
    }

    runFunc();
    return t;

</pre></div>
<p class="caption">Example 6b: Assembly listing of function with odd stack usage.</p>
<p>
This fictional function is far from pretty, and the epilogue is somewhat
more complicated.  The important instructions are the <CODE>LDR</CODE> into
r3 from a constant memory address, then the <CODE>NEG</CODE> operation before
the stack adjust.  Interlaced with this is an instruction to move the function's
return value into r0 in accordance with the ABI.  This requires the model ARM not
only to interpret a number of new instructions, but also provokes thought about
how the compiler generates awkward constant values.</p>
<p>
In ARM and Thumb mode there are a number of ways in which to generate a
constant value, and the model ARM will need to be able to interpret them all.
Worse still is the possibility that the desired constant, or some part of it,
has already been created for use by the function body an that the compiler
will use this already constructed value.  This means that the model not only
needs to be able to interpret any instructions that can be used to generate
constant values, but that it needs to be able to look outside the function
epilogue and into the function body too.  Therefore the model ARM becomes yet
more sophisticated and now attempts to interpret every instruction of the
program, starting at the PC and SP values from where the stack trace is
required, and stopping when some to be determined criteria is met.
</p>
<p>
Clearly it is desirable for the model ARM is to remain small, and so only the
subset of instructions that are needed for stack unwinding should be
implemented.  The required instructions that have been identified so far
are those that are involved in constant value generation, stack adjusting
and returning.  The question is what to do when an instruction that is
not understood is encountered.  The solution to this is simple - invalidate
all state and continue the interpretation!  As seen earlier, the
registers also have a status attached to their value, one status being
<CODE>REG_VAL_INVALID</CODE>.  Upon an uninterpreted instruction being
found, all registered values, with the exception of the PC and SP are
therefore invalidated.
</p>
<p>
Now that register values can be invalid, the rules of arithmetic also have
to change to propagate this meta data.  For example, a simple addition of
two registers to yield a value in a third should produce a result with
status <CODE>REG_VAL_INVALID</CODE> if either of the inputs is invalid.
Additionally a register <CODE>MOV</CODE> should copy not only the register
value, but the status too.  The following code fragment from the ARM
interpreting loop shows how the propagation of the register status
data is handled for Data Processing instructions.</p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">

        break;
}
</pre></div>
<p class="caption">Code 2: Propagation of register state in interpretation
of ARM Data Processing instruction.</p>
<p>
Now that the model is attempting to interpret all instructions, the handling
of conditional code needs to be considered.  Specifically the model must
meet the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>It must find the function epilogue for any function.
<li>It should not get stuck in loops.
<li>Infinite loops should be detectable.
<li>There should be no significant overhead on the interpretation.
</ul>
<p>
ARM instructions employ conditional guarding, meaning that condition codes
can be attached to most instructions such that they are only executed if the
condition is met.  Thumb mode uses conditional branch instructions, <CODE>BNE</CODE>
<CODE>BEQ</CODE> etc..., to achieve a similar goal, and in both cases the
Status Register (SR) holds the condition flags which determine if a branch is
taken or an ARM instruction executed.  Tracking the SR would apply overhead
and make the model more complex, as will any sort of branch analysis to find
infinite loops and function exits.  Therefore I make the following
assumptions, to simplify the model ARM.
<ul>
<li>All conditional code can be ignored.
<li>Conditional branches never need to be taken.
<li>Unconditional branched must always be taken.
</ul>
<p>It seems highly unlikely that the function epilogue will contain
conditional code and the 'stack moves once' rule of the ABI means that there
is no risk of needing to conditionally correct the stack depending on the
path taken through the function.  Unconditional branches must always be
taken since without them it is possible that interpretation could wander
into another function or data area.  Ignoring conditional branches also
greatly simplifies the interpreter, but introduces a risk that some loops
may appear infinite, as the following example shows.</p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
int loop()
{
    while(1)
    {
        int v = getch();

        if(v == EOF)      { break; }
        else if(v == 10)  { printf("\n"); }
        else              { printf("%c", v); }
    }

    return funcB();
}
</pre></div>
<p class="caption">Example 7a: Example loop where the exit condition is

</pre></div>
<p class="caption">Example 7b: Thumb assembly showing compiler output.</p>
<p>
In the above example, the <CODE>BEQ</CODE> needs to be taken in order to
reach the function epilogue.  Without understanding of the Status Register,
the model ARM cannot do this, so instead gets stuck in the loop - this is
the first caveat of the scheme.  Accepting for the moment that this type of
construct may occur (although I personally would try to avoid writing such
C code as it misses the purpose of the while statement!), a scheme for
detecting an infinite loop is required.  I opt simply to count the number
of instructions since a function return was discovered, and to stop the
interpretation if some predefined limit is exceeded.  This is very simple,
and has little overhead, although may take longer to determine that
unwinding is stuck than a more analytical approach would allow.
</p>
<p>
At this point, the model ARM should be capable of unwinding most stacks,
has the ability to interpret all the code that could appear in a function
epilogue and can interpret and detect returning to a register value
sourced from the stack.  The interpreter has a simple method to blunder
into most function epilogues and also has a primitive method of detecting
when it is stuck in an infinite loop.  A little polish can be applied to
trap cases such as the branching to a register whose value is invalid and
the scheme is basically working.  However, there are a couple of surprises
yet...</p>
<h3>Function Prologues</h3>
<p>
So far the model ARM has been built to concentrate on unwinding the
stack frames by interpretation of code leading up to and including the
function epilogues - the prologue has not needed consideration.  However,
there is an optimisation that can be supplied by a compiler that causes
prologues to become significant.  The optimisation is 'tail calling' but
is not specific to ARM architectures.</p>
<p>
Tail calling is when a function always calls another function as the last
thing that it does before returning.  The compiler can spot this pattern
and instead of generating return code from the first function, it can
call the second function in such a way that its return code will return to
the original caller.
</p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
void tailCall(int v)
{
    v *= v;
    printf("%d", v);
    tailFunc(v);
}
</pre></div>
<p class="caption">Example 8a: Function that makes a tail call.
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
tailCall PROC
        STMFD    sp!,{r4,lr}
        MUL      r4,r0,r0
        MOV      r1,r4
        ADR      r0,|L1.524|
        BL       __0printf
        MOV      r0,r4
        LDMFD    sp!,{r4,lr}
        B        tailFunc
        ENDP
</pre></div>
<p class="caption">Example 8b: ARM assembly listing of tail call function.
<p>
In this case, the Link Register (LR) is restored from the stack, but instead
of the commonly seen <CODE>BX</CODE>, an unconditional branch is made to
<CODE>tailFunc()</CODE>, such that <CODE>tailFunc()</CODE> will instead
return to the value placed in the LR.  It's a small optimisation
that saves a word and a few cycles, but it complicates the interpretation
performed by the model ARM.
<p>
To accommodate this, the model ARM must either be aware of tail calling and
ignore it, or must additionally be able to interpret function prologues.
Detecting the tail call would not be impossible, the pattern or restoring the
Link Register from the stack and then unconditionally branching is detectable,
but there could be a small risk of misdetection if the LR were
used in a function body for any purpose such as temporary storage or
arithmetic.</p>
<p>
Interpreting a function prologue is much the same as interpreting an epilogue
and the same instructions will be used to generate the constant value for
the stack adjust.  However, whereas previously all values were being read
from memory and the stack, some values are now stored to the stack to save
state before the function executes.  This could potentially damage the stack
on an executing system, so a small hash table to store memory addresses and
their values is implemented to store stack data instead; before reading from
memory the hash table is inspected, and if a value is found it is used in
place of the value from the device memory.  Since function prologues are
likely to start with a <CODE>PUSH</CODE> or <CODE>STMFD</CODE> instruction,
there is also the possibility of an invalid register value being stored to
memory, so the memory hash has to allow for storage of some state data to
prevent an invalid register value becoming valid if it is <CODE>PUSH</CODE>ed
and then <CODE>POP</CODE>ed from the stack.  Finally, to prevent the memory
hash needing to be large or risk overflowing, it is periodically purged of
data stored at addresses that are above the current top of the stack.</p>
<h3>Caveats</h3>
<p>
And there we have it - a scheme performing a kind of abstract interpretation
of ARM or Thumb code in order to unwind the stack frames.  However, while
small, this method of abstract interpretation is not quite perfect.  There
are a number of situations where it will not work, although the general case
so far suggests that it works very well in practice.  Still, there are
limitations, and these are best listed.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is possible for the compiler to construct loops that appear as infinite
due to the lack of interpretation of conditional code or branches.
<li>The unwinder interprets the return path of the code.  While this is
generally the same or very similar to the calling path, there are
circumstances where the two can be subtlety different.
<li>It is easy to construct code by hand that fools the interpretation.
<li>If the stack has already been corrupted, unwinding cannot succeed.
</ul>
<p>
The problem of infinite loops could be dealt with by adding a random element
to interpretation.  For example, if the model suspects itself to be stuck
in an infinite loop (a large number of instructions have been interpreted
with no function epilogue being found), it may start randomly taking
conditional branches in an attempt to 'chance upon' the function epilogue.
While more sophisticated methods of exiting infinite loops, such as tracking
the PC and marking branch history, could be implemented, they would require
more memory and complexity for something that has rarely been found to cause
a problem in practical usage of the unwinder.</p>
<p>
A greater problem with no solution is that of tail calling masking functions
from the unwound stack.  If the interpretation is started from a function
that was tail called, the function that made the tail call will be omitted
from the unwound stack.  In example 8, unwinding started from
<CODE>tailFunc()</CODE> or a sub-function thereof would omit to report
<CODE>tailCall()</CODE> since the return path would not pass through that
function.  In hindsight it may have been better to run the model ARM
backwards, although this presents different problems.
</p>
<H2>Implementation</H2>
<p>
The following shows the amount of code and data occupied by the unwinder
when compiler using RVCT2.1, compiled to Thumb code with -O2.  The totals
show that under 3k of ROM is used to implement the model ARM, which is
very acceptable for my application.

<p class="caption">Table 1: Unwinder code size (using RVCT2.1, TCC -O2).</p>
<p>
The unwinding code is implemented in a handful of files, and a single header
file named <CODE>unwarminder.h</CODE> needs to be included to access the
functionality.  Accessing to the system memory from the unwinder is
abstracted through callbacks that must be implemented by the 'client'
code, and this allows reads to be validated such that unwinding is
stopped if alignment or the address being read is at fault.  The client
code passes a small structure of function pointers to the unwinder to
equip it with the callbacks required to read memory and report return
addresses.</p>
<p>
The function that starts the unwinding is given as follows:
</p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
UnwResult UnwindStart(Int32                  spValue,
                      const UnwindCallbacks *cb,
                      void                  *data);
</pre></div>
<p class="caption">Code 3: The function to start unwinding.</p>
<p>
The <CODE>cb</CODE> structure gives the callbacks to allow memory
accesses and return address reporting, while the <CODE>data</CODE>
pointer can take any value and is passed to the reporting function
(<CODE>cb->report()</CODE>) such that it may store state if required.
</p>
<p>
The <CODE>spValue</CODE> gives the stack pointer value at which to
start unwinding; the PC value is determined automatically as it is
effectively passed to the function via the Link Register and so can
be retrieved.  When using RVCT, the compiler intrinsic function
<CODE>__current_sp()</CODE> allows the SP value to be read into a
variable, so a call to start unwinding typically looks something
like the following:</p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
const UnwindCallbacks cliCallbacks = { ... };
CliStack              results;
Int8                  t;
UnwResult             r;

results.frameCount = 0;
r = UnwindStart(__current_sp(), &amp;cliCallbacks, &amp;results);
</pre></div>
<p class="caption">Code 4: Typical call to start unwinding, passing
a pointer to some structure that lists all the callbacks, as well as
a pointer to local storage.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the implementation is not aware of any OS or memory protection
or management schemes that maybe in use on the target.  The system on which
this has been tested is simply configured with a flat memory map and has
few restrictions on memory access, and the RTOS used poses no restrictions
either.  It maybe the case that to use this on other targets the MMU or
MPU has to be reconfigured or disabled before unwinding is started, or the
functions used by the unwinder to access the memory specially constructed
to ensure that memory protections will not cause a problem.  Should the
unwinder request access to addresses that are genuinely invalid, the
client functions for memory access can return <CODE>FALSE</CODE> to indicate
that the memory cannot be accessed, and unwinding will terminate.

<H2>Licence and Download</H2>
<p>
The source code for the stack unwinder is available for free download and I'm
making it PUBLIC DOMAIN.  This means that there is no copyright and anyone
is able to take a copy for free and use it as they wish, with or without
modifications, and in any context they like, commercially or otherwise.
The only limitation is that I don't guarantee that the software is fit
for any purpose or accept any liability for its use or misuse - the software
is without warranty.</p>
<p>
Having said all this, the software has been ran under Valgrind and tested
both in PC simulations (using ARMSD) and on ARM7TDMI and ARM920T targets.

This package contains the source code for the unwinder as well as two 'clients'
that allow the unwinder to be exercised.  The first client is contained in two
files, <CODE>client.c</CODE> and <CODE>client.h</CODE> and can be built to
produce an image that can be executed either on an ARM target or in an emulator
and demonstrates the unwinding of the stack from which the unwinder is called.
The second client is the 'simulation' client, <CODE>simclient.c</CODE> and
<CODE>simclient.h</CODE>, which uses two memory images that are also supplied
and contain a snapshot of a call stack and executable code which allows
interpretation by the unwinder on a PC, where PC tools can also be used to
debug the unwinder.  The memory images supplied cannot however be ran on a
target since I've zero'd the areas of code that are not needed to demonstrate
the unwinder such that the ARM runtime is not present in binary form.
